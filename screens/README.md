# ScreenS

Takes screenshots of your Windows desktop.

Press `Alt+S` to save a screenshot in the directory from where the executable was run.

There is an icon in the system tray from where you can control the application.

If you have an issue with Windows 10 that the whole screen is not captured,
you should set the scaling to 100% in the display settings.

The icons are from the famfamfam [mini][] icons set. The link seems to be inactive now,
so here's an [archive link][mini-archive].
